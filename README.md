# maryo (Reverse fork)
## a proxy server used for accessing Reverse on Wii U

## about
maryo is a proxy program intended to be as easy as possible to use, the user interface comes first, then the features. if i were to focus more on the features, i could end up with a program that works, but i'd then have a bunch of people asking me how to use it.

## instructions

### using precompiled binaries

go to the releases, and download the correct binary for your system. just double-click it and follow the instructions (*it's that easy!*)

### building from source ~~(WARNING: EXTREMELY HARDCORE)~~

```
$ go get github.com/ReverseTeam/maryo
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ReverseTeam/maryo
$ go build
```
